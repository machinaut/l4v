chapter "Specifications"

(*
 * List of rules to make various images.
 *
 * Some rules have duplicate targets of the form:
 *
 *    theories [condition = "MOO", quick_and_dirty]
 *       "foo"
 *    theories
 *       "foo"
 *
 * The idea is that if the environment variable "MOO" is defined we
 * execute the first rule (doing the proof in quick-and-dirty mode), and
 * then find we need not take any action for the second. Otherwise, we
 * skip the first rule and only perform the second.
